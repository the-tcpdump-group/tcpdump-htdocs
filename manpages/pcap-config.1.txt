PCAP-CONFIG(1)              General Commands Manual             PCAP-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       pcap-config  - write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard out-
       put

SYNOPSIS
       pcap-config [ --help ] [ --version ] [ --cflags ]
                   [ --libs | --additional-libs ]
                   [ --static | --static-pcap-only ]

DESCRIPTION
       pcap-config writes to the standard output various compiler  and  linker
       flags  required  to  build a user program with libpcap.  By default, it
       writes flags appropriate for building with a dynamically-linked version
       of  libpcap;  see below for static linking.  Depending on the manner of
       libpcap installation, some options or their  combinations  may  produce
       empty output - this is by design.

OPTIONS
       --help Produce a help message and exit.

       --version
              Produce  libpcap  version and exit.  The version is the contents
              of VERSION file in libpcap source tree rather than the result of
              pcap_lib_version(3PCAP).

       --cflags
              Produce  the  -I  compiler  flag  required  to include libpcap's
              header files.

       --libs Produce the -L and -l linker flags required to link  with  libp-
              cap, including -l flags for libraries required by libpcap.

       --additional-libs
              Produce  the  -L  and  -l linker flags for libraries required by
              libpcap, but not the -l flag to link with libpcap itself.

       --static
              This option  causes  --libs  and  --additional-libs  to  produce
              linker flags appropriate for static linking with libpcap.

       --static-pcap-only
              This  option  causes  --libs  and  --additional-libs  to produce
              linker flags appropriate for static linking with libpcap and dy-
              namic  linking with all other libraries, including libraries re-
              quired by libpcap.

EXIT STATUS
       pcap-config exits with a non-zero status when invoked with  an  invalid
       command-line option, and with status 0 otherwise.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       Before  libpcap  release  1.10.2 pcap-config did not treat invalid com-
       mand-line options as  an  error.  The  --static-pcap-only  flag  became
       available  in  libpcap release 1.10.2.  The --static flag became avail-
       able in libpcap release 1.1.0.
