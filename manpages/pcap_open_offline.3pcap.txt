NAME
       pcap_open_offline,  pcap_fopen_offline  - open a saved capture file for
       reading

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_open_offline(const char *fname, char *errbuf);
       pcap_t *pcap_fopen_offline(FILE *fp, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_open_offline() is called to open a ``savefile'' for reading.

       fname specifies the name of the file to open. The  file  can  have  the
       pcap  file  format  as described in pcap-savefile(5), which is the file
       format used by, among other programs, tcpdump(1)  and  tcpslice(1),  or
       can have the pcap-ng file format, although not all pcap-ng files can be
       read.  The name "-" in a synonym for stdin.

       Alternatively, you may call pcap_fopen_offline() to  read  dumped  data
       from  an  existing  open  stream fp.  Note that on Windows, that stream
       should be opened in binary mode.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_open_offline() and pcap_fopen_offline() return a pcap_t * on  suc‐
       cess  and  NULL  on  failure.  If NULL is returned, errbuf is filled in
       with an appropriate error message.  errbuf is assumed  to  be  able  to
       hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
