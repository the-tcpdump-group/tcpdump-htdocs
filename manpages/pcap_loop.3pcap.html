<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_loop</B>()

processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile'' until
<I>cnt</I>

packets are processed, the end of the ``savefile'' is
reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
<A HREF='./pcap_breakloop.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_breakloop</B></A>(3PCAP)

is called, or an error occurs.
It does
<B>not</B>

return when live packet buffer timeouts occur.
A value of
<B>-1</B>

or
<B>0</B>

for
<I>cnt</I>

is equivalent to infinity, so that packets are processed until another
ending condition occurs.
<P>

<B>pcap_dispatch</B>()

processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile'' until
<I>cnt</I>

packets are processed, the end of the current bufferful of packets is
reached when doing a live capture, the end of the ``savefile'' is
reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
<B>pcap_breakloop</B>()

is called, or an error occurs.
Thus, when doing a live capture,
<I>cnt</I>

is the maximum number of packets to process before returning, but is not
a minimum number; when reading a live capture, only one
bufferful of packets is read at a time, so fewer than
<I>cnt</I>

packets may be processed. A value of
<B>-1</B>

or
<B>0</B>

for
<I>cnt</I>

causes all the packets received in one buffer to be processed when
reading a live capture, and causes all the packets in the file to be
processed when reading a ``savefile''.
<P>

Note that, when doing a live capture on some platforms, if the read
timeout expires when there are no packets available,
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>()

will return 0, even when not in non-blocking mode, as there are no
packets to process.  Applications should be prepared for this to happen,
but must not rely on it happening.
<P>

<I>callback</I>

specifies a
<CODE>pcap_handler</CODE>

routine to be called with three arguments:
a
<CODE>u_char</CODE>

pointer which is passed in the
<I>user</I>

argument to
<B>pcap_loop</B>()

or
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>(),

a
<CODE>const struct pcap_pkthdr</CODE>

pointer pointing to the packet time stamp and lengths, and a
<CODE>const u_char</CODE>

pointer to the first
<CODE>caplen</CODE>

(as given in the
<CODE>struct pcap_pkthdr</CODE>,

a pointer to which is passed to the callback routine)
bytes of data from the packet.  The
<CODE>struct pcap_pkthdr</CODE>

and the packet data are not to be freed by the callback routine, and are
not guaranteed to be valid after the callback routine returns; if the
code needs them to be valid after the callback, it must make a copy of
them.
<P>

The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
<A HREF='./pcap_datalink.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_datalink</B></A>(3PCAP)

routine when handed the
<CODE>pcap_t</CODE>

value also passed to
<B>pcap_loop</B>()

or
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>().

<I><A HREF="https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html">https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</A></I>

lists the values
<B>pcap_datalink</B>()

can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all
packets received unless and until
<A HREF='./pcap_set_datalink.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_set_datalink</B></A>(3PCAP)

is called; after a successful call to
<B>pcap_set_datalink</B>(),

all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type
specified by the link-layer header type value passed to
<B>pcap_set_datalink</B>().

<P>

Do
<B>NOT</B>

assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
<CODE>DLT_EN10MB</CODE>

for Ethernet.  For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
<CODE>DLT_LINUX_SLL</CODE>

or
<CODE>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</CODE>

even if all devices on the system at the time the &quot;any&quot; device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
<CODE>DLT_EN10MB</CODE>

for Ethernet.
<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_loop</B>()

returns
<B>0</B>

if
<I>cnt</I>

is exhausted or if, when reading from a ``savefile'', no more packets
are available.  It returns
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</CODE>

if the loop terminated due to a call to
<B>pcap_breakloop</B>()

before any packets were processed,
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</CODE>

if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,
or
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

if another error occurs.
It does
<B>not</B>

return when live packet buffer timeouts occur; instead, it attempts to
read more packets.
<P>

<B>pcap_dispatch</B>()

returns the number of packets processed on success; this can be 0 if no
packets were read from a live capture (if, for example, they were
discarded because they didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on
platforms that support a packet buffer timeout that starts before any
packets arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the
file descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no
packets were available to be read) or if no more packets are available
in a ``savefile.'' It returns
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</CODE>

if the loop terminated due to a call to
<B>pcap_breakloop</B>()

before any packets were processed,
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</CODE>

if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,
or
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

if another error occurs.
<B>
If your application uses pcap_breakloop(),
make sure that you explicitly check for PCAP_ERROR and PCAP_ERROR_BREAK,
rather than just checking for a return value &lt; 0.
</B>
<P>

If
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

is returned,
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_geterr</B></A>(3PCAP)

or
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_perror</B></A>(3PCAP)

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<H2 id="lbAF">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

In libpcap versions before 1.5.0, the behavior when
<I>cnt</I>

was
<B>0</B>

was undefined; different platforms and devices behaved differently,
so code that must work with these versions of libpcap should use
<B>-1</B>,

not
<B>0</B>,

as the value of
<I>cnt</I>.
