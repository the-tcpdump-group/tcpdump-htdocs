PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_TYPE(3PCAP)                        PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_TYPE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_type  - set the time stamp type to be used by a capture
       device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_type(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_type);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_type() sets the type of time stamp desired for  packets
       captured  on  the pcap descriptor to the type specified by tstamp_type.
       It must be called on a pcap descriptor  created  by  pcap_create(3PCAP)
       that    has   not   yet   been   activated   by   pcap_activate(3PCAP).
       pcap_list_tstamp_types(3PCAP) will give a list of the time stamp  types
       supported  by a given capture device.  See pcap-tstamp(7) for a list of
       all the time stamp types.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_type() returns 0 on success if the specified time stamp
       type  is  expected  to  be  supported by the capture device, PCAP_WARN-
       ING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP if the specified time stamp  type  is  not  sup-
       ported  by the capture device, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if called on a cap-
       ture handle that has been activated, and PCAP_ERROR_CANTSET_TSTAMP_TYPE
       if the capture device doesn't support setting the time stamp type (only
       older versions of libpcap will return that; newer versions will  always
       allow the time stamp type to be set to the default type).

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This  function  became available in libpcap release 1.2.1.  In previous
       releases, the time stamp type cannot be  set;  only  the  default  time
       stamp type offered by a capture source is available.
