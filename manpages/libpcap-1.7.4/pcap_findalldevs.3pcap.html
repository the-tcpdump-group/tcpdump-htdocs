<H2 id="lbAB">NAME</H2>

pcap_findalldevs, pcap_freealldevs - get a list of capture devices, and
free that list
<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
</B>
<B>int pcap_findalldevs(pcap_if_t **alldevsp, char *errbuf);
void pcap_freealldevs(pcap_if_t *alldevs);
</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_findalldevs()</B>

constructs a list of network devices that can be opened with
<B>pcap_create()</B>

and
<B>pcap_activate()</B>

or with
<B>pcap_open_live()</B>.

(Note that there may be network devices that cannot be opened by the
process calling
<B>pcap_findalldevs()</B>,

because, for example, that process does not have sufficient privileges
to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will not appear on the
list.)
If
<B>pcap_findalldevs()</B>

succeeds, the pointer pointed to by
<I>alldevsp</I>

is set to point to the first element of the list, or to
<B>NULL</B>

if no devices were found (this is considered success).
Each element of the list is of type
<B>pcap_if_t</B>,

and has the following members:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><B>next</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to the next element in the list;
<B>NULL</B>

for the last element of the list
<DT><B>name</B>

<DD>
a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to
<B>pcap_open_live()</B>

<DT><B>description</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to a string giving a human-readable description of the device
<DT><B>addresses</B>

<DD>
a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the
device,
or
<B>NULL</B>

if the device has no addresses
<DT><B>flags</B>

<DD>
device flags:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><B>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK</B>

<DD>
set if the device is a loopback interface
<DT><B>PCAP_IF_UP</B>

<DD>
set if the device is up
<DT><B>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</B>

<DD>
set if the device is running
</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Each element of the list of addresses is of type
<B>pcap_addr_t</B>,

and has the following members:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><B>next</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to the next element in the list;
<B>NULL</B>

for the last element of the list
<DT><B>addr</B>

<DD>
a pointer to a
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

containing an address
<DT><B>netmask</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to a
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

that contains the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to by
<B>addr</B>

<DT><B>broadaddr</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to a
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

that contains the broadcast address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
<B>addr</B>;

may be null if the device doesn't support broadcasts
<DT><B>dstaddr</B>

<DD>
if not
<B>NULL</B>,

a pointer to a
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

that contains the destination address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
<B>addr</B>;

may be null if the device isn't a point-to-point interface
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so you must
check the
<B>sa_family</B>

member of the
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

before interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the
addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
IPv4 addresses have the value
<B>AF_INET</B>,

IPv6 addresses have the value
<B>AF_INET6</B>

(which older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not
define), and other addresses have other values.  Whether other addresses
are returned, and what types they might have is platform-dependent.
For IPv4 addresses, the
<B>struct sockaddr</B>

pointer can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
<B>struct sockaddr_in</B>;

for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
<B>struct sockaddr_in6.</B>

<P>

The list of devices must be freed with
<B>pcap_freealldevs()</B>,

which frees the list pointed to by
<I>alldevs</I>.

<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_findalldevs()</B>

returns 0 on success and -1 on failure; as indicated, finding no
devices is considered success, rather than failure, so 0 will be
returned in that case.
If -1 is returned,
<I>errbuf</I>

is filled in with an appropriate error message.
<I>errbuf</I>

is assumed to be able to hold at least
<B>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</B>

chars.
