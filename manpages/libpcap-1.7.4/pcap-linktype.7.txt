PCAP-LINKTYPE(7)       Miscellaneous Information Manual       PCAP-LINKTYPE(7)

NAME
       pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported by libpcap

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  live  capture  or ``savefile'', libpcap supplies, as the return
       value of the pcap_datalink(3PCAP) routine, a value that  indicates  the
       type  of link-layer header at the beginning of the packets it provides.
       This is not necessarily the type of link-layer header that the  packets
       being  captured  have on the network from which they're being captured;
       for example, packets from an IEEE 802.11 network might be  provided  by
       libpcap  with  Ethernet headers that the network adapter or the network
       adapter driver generates from the 802.11 headers.  The names for  those
       values begin with DLT_, so they are sometimes called "DLT_ values".

       The  values  stored in the link-layer header type field in the savefile
       header are, in most but not all cases, the same as the values  returned
       by pcap_datalink().  The names for those values begin with LINKTYPE_.

       The  link-layer  header  types  supported  by  libpcap are described at
       http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html.
