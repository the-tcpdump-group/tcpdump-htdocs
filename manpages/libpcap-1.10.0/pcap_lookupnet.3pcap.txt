PCAP_LOOKUPNET(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_LOOKUPNET(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_lookupnet - find the IPv4 network number and netmask for a device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_lookupnet(const char *device, bpf_u_int32 *netp,
               bpf_u_int32 *maskp, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_lookupnet()  is used to determine the IPv4 network number and mask
       associated with the network device device.  Both  netp  and  maskp  are
       bpf_u_int32 pointers.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_lookupnet()  returns  0  on  success and PCAP_ERROR on failure. If
       PCAP_ERROR is returned, errbuf is filled in with an  appropriate  error
       message.   errbuf  is  assumed  to  be  able  to hold at least PCAP_ER-
       RBUF_SIZE chars.
