NAME
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_activate()  is used to activate a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network, with the options that were set  on  the  handle
       being in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_activate()  returns  0  on  success  without  warnings, PCAP_WARN‐
       ING_PROMISC_NOTSUP on success on a device that doesn't support  promis‐
       cuous    mode   if   promiscuous   mode   was   requested,   PCAP_WARN‐
       ING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP on success if the time stamp type specified in a
       previous  pcap_set_tstamp_type()  call  isn't  supported by the capture
       source (the time stamp type is left as the  default),  PCAP_WARNING  on
       success  with any other warning, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if the handle has
       already been activated, PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE if the capture source
       specified    when    the    handle    was    created   doesn't   exist,
       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED if the process doesn't have permission  to  open
       the  capture  source, PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED if the process has
       permission to open the capture source but doesn't  have  permission  to
       put  it  into promiscuous mode, PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP if monitor mode
       was specified but the capture  source  doesn't  support  monitor  mode,
       PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP if the capture source is not up, and PCAP_ERROR
       if another error occurred.  If PCAP_WARNING or PCAP_ERROR is  returned,
       pcap_geterr()  or  pcap_perror() may be called with p as an argument to
       fetch or display  a  message  describing  the  warning  or  error.   If
       PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP,        PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE,       or
       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED is returned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror()  may
       be  called  with p as an argument to fetch or display an message giving
       additional details about the problem that might be useful for debugging
       the problem if it's unexpected.
