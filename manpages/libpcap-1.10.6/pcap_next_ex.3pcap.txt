PCAP_NEXT_EX(3PCAP)                                        PCAP_NEXT_EX(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_next_ex, pcap_next - read the next packet from a pcap_t

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_next_ex(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr **pkt_header,
           const u_char **pkt_data);
       const u_char *pcap_next(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr *h);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_next_ex()  reads the next packet and returns a success/failure in-
       dication.  If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed
       to by the pkt_header argument is set to point to the pcap_pkthdr struct
       for the packet, and the pointer pointed to by the pkt_data argument  is
       set to point to the data in the packet.  The struct pcap_pkthdr and the
       packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are  not  guaranteed
       to  be  valid  after  the  next  call  to  pcap_next_ex(), pcap_next(),
       pcap_loop(3PCAP), or pcap_dispatch(3PCAP); if the code  needs  them  to
       remain valid, it must make a copy of them.

       pcap_next()  reads  the  next packet (by calling pcap_dispatch() with a
       cnt of 1) and returns a u_char pointer to the data in that packet.  The
       packet  data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not guaranteed to
       be  valid  after  the  next  call   to   pcap_next_ex(),   pcap_next(),
       pcap_loop(),  or pcap_dispatch(); if the code needs it to remain valid,
       it must make a copy of it.  The pcap_pkthdr structure pointed to  by  h
       is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.

       The  bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
       format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
       pcap_datalink(3PCAP)  routine  when handed the pcap_t value also passed
       to  pcap_loop()  or   pcap_dispatch().    https://www.tcpdump.org/link-
       types.html  lists  the  values pcap_datalink() can return and describes
       the packet formats that correspond to those values.  The value  it  re-
       turns  will  be  valid  for  all  packets  received  unless  and  until
       pcap_set_datalink(3PCAP)  is  called;  after  a  successful   call   to
       pcap_set_datalink(),  all  subsequent  packets  will  have a link-layer
       header of the type specified by the link-layer header type value passed
       to pcap_set_datalink().

       Do NOT assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will
       have any given link-layer header type, such as DLT_EN10MB for Ethernet.
       For  example,  the  "any" device on Linux will have a link-layer header
       type of DLT_LINUX_SLL or DLT_LINUX_SLL2 even if all devices on the sys-
       tem  at  the  time the "any" device is opened have some other data link
       type, such as DLT_EN10MB for Ethernet.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_next_ex() returns 1 if the packet was read without problems, 0  if
       packets  are being read from a live capture and the packet buffer time-
       out expired, PCAP_ERROR_BREAK if packets are being read from a  ``save-
       file''  and  there  are  no  more  packets  to  read from the savefile,
       PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if called on a capture handle  that  has  been
       created  but  not  activated,  or PCAP_ERROR if an error occurred while
       reading the packet.  If PCAP_ERROR is returned,  pcap_geterr(3PCAP)  or
       pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an argument to fetch or dis-
       play the error text.

       pcap_next() returns a pointer to the packet data on  success,  and  re-
       turns NULL if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live
       capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't  pass
       the  packet  filter,  or  if, on platforms that support a packet buffer
       timeout that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires  be-
       fore  any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture de-
       vice is in non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read),
       or  if  no more packets are available in a ``savefile''. Unfortunately,
       there is no way to determine whether an error occurred or not.
