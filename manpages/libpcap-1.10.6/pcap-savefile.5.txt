PCAP-SAVEFILE(5)              File Formats Manual             PCAP-SAVEFILE(5)

NAME
       pcap-savefile - libpcap savefile format

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:  applications  and  libraries should, if possible, use libpcap to
       read savefiles, rather than having their own code  to  read  savefiles.
       If,  in the future, a new file format is supported by libpcap, applica-
       tions and libraries using libpcap to read savefiles  will  be  able  to
       read  the new format of savefiles, but applications and libraries using
       their own code to read savefiles will have to be changed to support the
       new file format.

       ``Savefiles''  read and written by libpcap and applications using libp-
       cap start with a per-file header.  The format of  the  per-file  header
       is:

              +--------------------------------------------------+
              |                  Magic number                    |
              +------------------------+-------------------------+
              |     Major version      |      Minor version      |
              +------------------------+-------------------------+
              |                    Reserved1                     |
              +--------------------------------------------------+
              |                    Reserved2                     |
              +--------------------------------------------------+
              |                 Snapshot length                  |
              +--------------------------------------------------+
              |Link-layer header type and additional information |
              +--------------------------------------------------+
       The per-file header length is 24 octets.

       All  fields  in  the  per-file header are in the byte order of the host
       writing the file.  Normally, the first field in the per-file header  is
       a  4-byte  magic  number, with the value 0xa1b2c3d4.  The magic number,
       when read by a host with the same byte order as the host that wrote the
       file, will have the value 0xa1b2c3d4, and, when read by a host with the
       opposite byte order as the host that wrote  the  file,  will  have  the
       value  0xd4c3b2a1.   That allows software reading the file to determine
       whether the byte order of the host that wrote the file is the  same  as
       the  byte  order  of the host on which the file is being read, and thus
       whether the values in the per-file and per-packet headers  need  to  be
       byte-swapped.

       If  the  magic number has the value 0xa1b23c4d (with the two nibbles of
       the two lower-order bytes of the magic number swapped), which would  be
       read  as 0xa1b23c4d by a host with the same byte order as the host that
       wrote the file and as 0x4d3cb2a1 by a host with the opposite byte order
       as  the  host  that  wrote the file, the file format is the same as for
       regular files, except that the time stamps for  packets  are  given  in
       seconds and nanoseconds rather than seconds and microseconds.

       Following this are:

              A  2-byte  file format major version number; the current version
              number is 2 (big-endian 0x00 0x02 or little-endian 0x02 0x00).

              A 2-byte file format minor version number; the  current  version
              number is 4 (big-endian 0x00 0x04 or little-endian 0x04 0x00).

              A  4-byte  not used - SHOULD be filled with 0 by pcap file writ-
              ers, and MUST be ignored by pcap file readers.  This  value  was
              documented  by  some older implementations as "gmt to local cor-
              rection" or "time zone offset".  Some older  pcap  file  writers
              stored non-zero values in this field.

              A  4-byte  not used - SHOULD be filled with 0 by pcap file writ-
              ers, and MUST be ignored by pcap file readers.  This  value  was
              documented  by  some older implementations as "accuracy of time-
              stamps".  Some older pcap file writers stored non-zero values in
              this field.

              A  4-byte  number  giving  the "snapshot length" of the capture;
              packets longer than the snapshot length  are  truncated  to  the
              snapshot  length, so that, if the snapshot length is N, only the
              first N bytes of a packet longer than N bytes will be  saved  in
              the capture.

              A 4-byte number giving the link-layer header type for packets in
              the capture and optional additional information.

              This format of this field is:

                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |FCS len|R|P|     Reserved3     |        Link-layer type        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              The field is shown as if it were in the byte order of  the  host
              reading  or writing the file, with bit 0 being the most-signifi-
              cant bit of the field and bit 31 being the least-significant bit
              of the field.

              Link-layer  type (16 bits): A 16-bit value giving the link-layer
              header type for packets in the file;  see  pcap-linktype(7)  for
              the LINKTYPE_ values that can appear in this field.

              Reserved3  (10  bits):  not  used  - MUST be set to zero by pcap
              writers, and MUST NOT be interpreted by pcap readers;  a  reader
              SHOULD treat a non-zero value as an error.

              P  (1  bit):  A bit that, if set, indicates that the Frame Check
              Sequence (FCS) length value is present and, if  not  set,  indi-
              cates that the FCS value is not present.

              R  (1  bit): not used - MUST be set to zero by pcap writers, and
              MUST NOT be interpreted by pcap readers; a reader SHOULD treat a
              non-zero value as an error.

              FCS  len  (4  bits): A 4-bit unsigned value giving the number of
              16-bit (2-octet) words of FCS that are appended to each  packet,
              if the P bit is set; if the P bit is not set, and the FCS length
              is not indicated by the link-layer type value, the FCS length is
              unknown.   The  valid  values of the FCS len field are between 0
              and 15; Ethernet, for example, would have an FCS length value of
              2, corresponding to a 4-octet FCS.

       Following the per-file header are zero or more packets; each packet be-
       gins with a per-packet header, which is immediately followed by the raw
       packet data.  The format of the per-packet header is:

              +----------------------------------------------+
              |          Time stamp, seconds value           |
              +----------------------------------------------+
              |Time stamp, microseconds or nanoseconds value |
              +----------------------------------------------+
              |       Length of captured packet data         |
              +----------------------------------------------+
              |   Un-truncated length of the packet data     |
              +----------------------------------------------+
       The per-packet header length is 16 octets.

       All  fields  in the per-packet header are in the byte order of the host
       writing the file.  The per-packet header begins with a time stamp  giv-
       ing  the  approximate time the packet was captured; the time stamp con-
       sists of a 4-byte value, giving the time in seconds  since  January  1,
       1970,  00:00:00 UTC, followed by a 4-byte value, giving the time in mi-
       croseconds or nanoseconds since that second,  depending  on  the  magic
       number  in  the  file header.  Following that are a 4-byte value giving
       the number of bytes of captured data that follow the per-packet  header
       and  a  4-byte  value  giving  the number of bytes that would have been
       present had the packet not been truncated by the snapshot length.   The
       two  lengths  will  be  equal if the number of bytes of packet data are
       less than or equal to the snapshot length.
