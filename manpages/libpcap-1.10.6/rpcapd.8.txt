RPCAPD(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  RPCAPD(8)

NAME
       rpcapd  -  capture daemon to be controlled by a remote libpcap applica-
       tion

SYNOPSIS
       rpcapd [ -b address ] [ -p port ] [ -4 ] [ -l host_list ]
               [ -a host,port ] [ -n ] [ -v ] [ -d ] [ -i ]
               [ -D ] [ -s config_file ] [ -f config_file ] [ -S ]
               [ -K ssl_keyfile ] [ -X ssl_certfile ] [ -C ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rpcapd is a daemon (Unix) or service (Win32) that  allows  the  capture
       and filter part of libpcap to be run on a remote system.

       Rpcapd can run in two modes: passive mode (default) and active mode.

       In  passive  mode, the client (e.g., a network sniffer) connects to rp-
       capd.  The client then sends the  appropriate  commands  to  rpcapd  to
       start the capture.

       In  active  mode,  rpcapd  tries  to  establish a connection toward the
       client (e.g., a network sniffer). The client then sends the appropriate
       commands to rpcapd to start the capture.

       Active  mode is useful in case rpcapd is run behind a firewall and can-
       not receive connections from the external world. In this  case,  rpcapd
       can  be  configured  to establish the connection to a given host, which
       has to be configured in order to wait for that connection. After estab-
       lishing  the  connection,  the protocol continues its job in almost the
       same way in both active and passive mode.

Configuration file
       The user can create a configuration file in the same directory  as  the
       executable,  and  put the configuration commands in there. In order for
       rpcapd to execute the commands, it needs to be restarted on Win32, i.e.
       the  configuration  file is parsed only at the beginning. The UNIX ver-
       sion of rpcapd will reread the configuration file upon receiving a  HUP
       signal.  In  that  case,  all the existing connections remain in place,
       while the new connections will be created according to the new  parame-
       ters.

       In case a user does not want to create the configuration file manually,
       they can launch rpcapd with the desired flags plus -s filename.  Rpcapd
       will parse all the parameters and save them into the specified configu-
       ration file.

Installing rpcapd on Win32
       The remote daemon is installed automatically when  installing  WinPcap.
       The  installation  process  places  the rpcapd executable file into the
       WinPcap folder.  This file can be  executed  either  from  the  command
       line,  or as a service.  For instance, the installation process updates
       the list of available services list and it creates a new  item  (Remote
       Packet  Capture  Protocol v.0 (experimental)).  To avoid security prob-
       lems, the service is inactive and it has to be started  manually  (con-
       trol panel - administrative tools - services - start).

       The  service  has  a  set of "standard" parameters, i.e. it is launched
       with the -d flag (in order to make it run as a service) and the -f  rp-
       capd.ini flag.

Starting rpcapd on Win32
       The rpcapd executable can be launched directly, i.e.  it can run in the
       foreground as well (not as a daemon/service).  The procedure  is  quite
       simple:  you  have  to invoke the executable from the command line with
       all the requested parameters except  for  the  -d  flag.   The  capture
       server will start in the foreground.

Installing rpcapd on Unix-like systems
       TBD

Starting rpcapd on Unix-like systems
       rpcapd needs sufficient privileges to perform packet capture, e.g.  run
       as root or be owned by root and have suid set. Most  operating  systems
       provide  more  elegant  solutions when run as user than the above solu-
       tions, all of them different.

       If your system supports systemd(1) and the corresponding  rpcapd.socket
       and  rpcapd@.service service files have been installed, the rpcapd ser-
       vice can be enabled by enabling the rpcapd.socket unit.

       If your system supports  launchd(8)  and  the  org.tcpdump.rpcapd.plist
       file  has  been installed, the rpcapd service can be enabled by loading
       the org.tcpdump.rpcapd service.

       If your system supports inetd(8) and the  rpcapd.inetd.conf  entry  has
       been  added  to  inetd.conf(5),  the  rpcapd  service can be enabled by
       telling inetd to reread its configuration file.

       If your system supports xinetd(8) and the rpcapd.xinetd.conf entry  has
       been  added  to  xinetd.conf(5),  the  rpcapd service can be enabled by
       telling xinetd to reread its configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -b address
              Bind to the IP address specified by address (either  numeric  or
              literal).   By  default, rpcapd binds to all local IPv4 and IPv6
              addresses.

       -p port
              Bind to the port specified by port.  By default, rpcapd binds to
              port 2002.

       -4     Listen  only  on  IPv4 addresses.  By default, rpcapd listens on
              both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

       -l host_list
              Only allow hosts specified in the host_list argument to  connect
              to  this  server.   host_list  is a list of host names or IP ad-
              dresses, separated by commas.  We  suggest  that  you  use  host
              names  rather  than literal IP addresses in order to avoid prob-
              lems with different address families.

       -n     Permit NULL authentication (usually used with the -l flag).

       -a host,port
              Run in active mode, connecting to host host on  port  port.   In
              case port is omitted, the default port (2003) is used.

       -v     Run  in active mode only; by default, if -a is specified, rpcapd
              accepts passive connections as well.

       -d     Run in daemon mode (UNIX only) or as  a  service  (Win32  only).
              Warning  (Win32):  this flag is specified automatically when the
              service is started from the control panel.

       -i     Run in inetd mode (UNIX only).

       -D     Log debugging messages.

       -s config_file
              Save the current configuration  to  config_file  in  the  format
              specified by rpcapd-config(5).

       -f config_file
              Load  the  current  configuration from config_file in the format
              specified by rpcapd-config(5) and ignore all flags specified  on
              the command line.

       -h     Print this help screen.

       If rpcapd was compiled with SSL support, the following options are also
       available:

       -S     Require that SSL be used on connections.

       -C     With SSL enabled, XXX - I'm not sure how *fetching* the list  of
              compression mechanisms does anything to compression.

       -S ssl_keyfile
              With SSL enabled, use ssl_keyfile as the SSL key file.

       -X ssl_certfile
              With SSL enabled, use ssl_certfile as the SSL certificate file.
