PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)                              PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_setdirection  -  set  the direction for which packets will be cap-
       tured

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_setdirection(pcap_t *p, pcap_direction_t d);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_setdirection() is used to specify a direction that packets will be
       captured.    d  is  one  of  the  constants  PCAP_D_IN,  PCAP_D_OUT  or
       PCAP_D_INOUT.  PCAP_D_IN will only capture packets received by the  de-
       vice,  PCAP_D_OUT  will  only  capture  packets  sent by the device and
       PCAP_D_INOUT will capture packets received by or sent  by  the  device.
       PCAP_D_INOUT is the default setting if this function is not called.

       pcap_setdirection() isn't necessarily fully supported on all platforms;
       some platforms might return an error for all  values,  and  some  other
       platforms might not support PCAP_D_OUT.

       This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being read.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_setdirection()  returns  0 on success, PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if
       called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,  or
       PCAP_ERROR    on    other    errors.   If   PCAP_ERROR   is   returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an ar-
       gument to fetch or display the error text.
