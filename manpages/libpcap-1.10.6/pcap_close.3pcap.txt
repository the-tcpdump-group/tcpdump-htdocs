PCAP_CLOSE(3PCAP)                                            PCAP_CLOSE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_close - close a capture device or savefile

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       void pcap_close(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_close()  closes  the  files  associated with p and deallocates re-
       sources. This means that, for example, if p refers to a  savefile  that
       was     opened    with    pcap_fopen_offline()    or    pcap_fopen_off-
       line_with_tstamp_precision(), the stream provided to the  routine  will
       be closed unless it is stdin.

SEE ALSO
       pcap(3PCAP), pcap_open_offline(3PCAP)
