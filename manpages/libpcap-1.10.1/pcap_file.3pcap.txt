PCAP_FILE(3PCAP)                                              PCAP_FILE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_file - get the standard I/O stream for a savefile being read

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       FILE *pcap_file(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_file()  returns  the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile,'' if a
       ``savefile'' was opened with pcap_open_offline(3PCAP), or  NULL,  if  a
       network    device    was    opened    with    pcap_create(3PCAP)    and
       pcap_activate(3PCAP), or with pcap_open_live(3PCAP).

       Note that the Packet Capture library is usually built with  large  file
       support,  so the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile'' might refer to
       a file larger than  2  gigabytes;  applications  that  use  pcap_file()
       should,  if  possible, use calls that support large files on the return
       value of pcap_file() or the value returned by fileno(3) when passed the
       return value of pcap_file().
