PCAP_GET_SELECTABLE_FD(3PCAP)                    PCAP_GET_SELECTABLE_FD(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_get_selectable_fd  - get a file descriptor on which a select() can
       be done for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_get_selectable_fd(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_get_selectable_fd() returns, on UNIX, a file descriptor number for
       a   file   descriptor  on  which  one  can  do  a  select(2),  poll(2),
       epoll_wait(2), kevent(2), or other such call to wait for it to be  pos-
       sible to read packets without blocking, if such a descriptor exists, or
       -1, if no such descriptor exists.

       Some network devices  opened  with  pcap_create(3PCAP)  and  pcap_acti-
       vate(3PCAP),  or with pcap_open_live(3PCAP), do not support those calls
       (for example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4,  and  En-
       dace  DAG devices), so -1 is returned for those devices.  In that case,
       those calls must be given a timeout less than or equal to  the  timeout
       returned  by pcap_get_required_select_timeout(3PCAP) for the device for
       which pcap_get_selectable_fd() returned -1, the device must be  put  in
       non-blocking  mode  with  a call to pcap_setnonblock(3PCAP), and an at-
       tempt must always be made to read packets from the device when the call
       returns.  If pcap_get_required_select_timeout() returns NULL, it is not
       possible to wait for packets to arrive on the device in an event loop.

       Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking may, on
       some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer time-
       out has expired.  A call to pcap_dispatch(3PCAP) or pcap_next_ex(3PCAP)
       will return 0 in this case, but will not block.

       Note that in:

              FreeBSD prior to FreeBSD 4.6;

              NetBSD prior to NetBSD 3.0;

              OpenBSD prior to OpenBSD 2.4;

              Mac OS X prior to Mac OS X 10.7;

       select(),  poll(),  and  kevent() do not work correctly on BPF devices;
       pcap_get_selectable_fd() will return a file descriptor on most of those
       versions  (the  exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), but a simple se-
       lect(), poll(), or kevent() call will not indicate that the  descriptor
       is readable until a full buffer's worth of packets is received, even if
       the packet timeout expires before then.  To work around this, code that
       uses  those  calls to wait for packets to arrive must put the pcap_t in
       non-blocking mode, and must arrange that the call have a  timeout  less
       than  or equal to the packet buffer timeout, and must try to read pack-
       ets after that timeout expires, regardless of whether  the  call  indi-
       cated  that  the  file descriptor for the pcap_t is ready to be read or
       not.  (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD 4.3 and later; however,
       in FreeBSD 4.6 and later, those calls work correctly on BPF devices, so
       the workaround isn't necessary, although it does no harm.)

       Note also that poll() and kevent() doesn't work  on  character  special
       files,  including BPF devices, in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, so, while se-
       lect()  can  be  used  on  the  descriptor  returned  by   pcap_get_se-
       lectable_fd(),  poll() and kevent() cannot be used on it those versions
       of Mac OS X.  poll(), but not kevent(), works on that descriptor in Mac
       OS  X releases prior to 10.4; poll() and kevent() work on that descrip-
       tor in Mac OS X 10.6 and later.

       pcap_get_selectable_fd() is not available on Windows.

RETURN VALUE
       A selectable file descriptor is returned if one exists;  otherwise,  -1
       is returned.
