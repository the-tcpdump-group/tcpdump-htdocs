PCAP_DUMP_FTELL(3PCAP)                                  PCAP_DUMP_FTELL(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_dump_ftell,  pcap_dump_ftell64 - get the current file offset for a
       savefile being written

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       long pcap_dump_ftell(pcap_dumper_t *p);
       int64_t pcap_dump_ftell64(pcap_dumper_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_ftell() returns the current file  position  for  the  ``save-
       file'',    representing    the    number    of    bytes    written   by
       pcap_dump_open(3PCAP) and pcap_dump(3PCAP).  PCAP_ERROR is returned  on
       error.  If the current file position does not fit in a long, it will be
       truncated; this can happen on 32-bit UNIX-like systems with large  file
       support  and  on Windows.  pcap_dump_ftell64() returns the current file
       position in a int64_t, so if file offsets that don't fit in a long  but
       that  fit  in a int64_t are supported, this will return the file offset
       without truncation.  PCAP_ERROR is returned on error.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       The function pcap_dump_ftell64() became available  in  libpcap  release
       1.9.0.   In  previous releases, there was no mechanism to obtain a file
       offset that is too large to fit in a long.
