PCAP_DATALINK(3PCAP)                                      PCAP_DATALINK(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_datalink - get the link-layer header type

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_datalink(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_datalink() returns the link-layer header type for the live capture
       or ``savefile'' specified by p.

       It must not be called on a pcap  descriptor  created  by  pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().

       http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html  lists the values pcap_datalink()
       can return and describes the packet formats that  correspond  to  those
       values.

       Do NOT assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will
       have any given link-layer header type, such as DLT_EN10MB for Ethernet.
       For  example,  the  "any" device on Linux will have a link-layer header
       type of DLT_LINUX_SLL even if all devices on the system at the time the
       "any"  device  is  opened  have  some  other  data  link  type, such as
       DLT_EN10MB for Ethernet.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_datalink() returns the  link-layer  header  type  on  success  and
       PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if  called  on a capture handle that has been
       created but not activated.
