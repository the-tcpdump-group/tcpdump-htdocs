PCAP_LIST_TSTAMP_TYPES(3PCAP)                    PCAP_LIST_TSTAMP_TYPES(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_list_tstamp_types,  pcap_free_tstamp_types  -  get  a list of time
       stamp types supported by a capture device, and free that list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_list_tstamp_types(pcap_t *p, int **tstamp_typesp);
       void pcap_free_tstamp_types(int *tstamp_types);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_list_tstamp_types() is used to get a list of  the  supported  time
       stamp  types  of  the  interface  associated  with the pcap descriptor.
       pcap_list_tstamp_types() allocates an array to hold the list  and  sets
       *tstamp_typesp to point to the array.  See pcap-tstamp(7) for a list of
       all the time stamp types.

       The   caller   is   responsible   for   freeing    the    array    with
       pcap_free_tstamp_types(),   which   frees   the   list  pointed  to  by
       tstamp_types.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_list_tstamp_types() returns the number of time stamp types in  the
       array  on  success  and  PCAP_ERROR  on failure.  A return value of one
       means that the only time stamp type supported is the one in  the  list,
       which  is the capture device's default time stamp type.  A return value
       of  zero  means  that  the  only   time   stamp   type   supported   is
       PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST, which is the capture device's default time stamp type
       (only older versions of libpcap will return that; newer  versions  will
       always   return  one  or  more  types).   If  PCAP_ERROR  is  returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an ar-
       gument to fetch or display the error text.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       These functions became available in libpcap release 1.2.1.  In previous
       releases, the time stamp type cannot be  set;  only  the  default  time
       stamp type offered by a capture source is available.
