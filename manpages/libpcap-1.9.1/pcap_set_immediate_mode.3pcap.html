<H2 id="lbAB">NAME</H2>

pcap_set_immediate_mode - set immediate mode for a not-yet-activated capture
handle
<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;

int pcap_set_immediate_mode(pcap_t *p, int immediate_mode);
</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</B>

sets whether immediate mode should be set on a capture handle when
the handle is activated.  In immediate mode, packets are always
delivered as soon as they arrive, with no buffering.
If
<I>immediate_mode</I>

is non-zero, immediate mode will be set, otherwise it will not be set.
<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</B>

returns 0 on success or
<B>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED</B>

if called on a capture handle that has been activated.
<H2 id="lbAF">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.0.  In previous
releases, if immediate delivery of packets is required:
<DL>
<DT><DD>
on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, macOS, and Solaris 11,
immediate mode must be turned on with a
<B>BIOCIMMEDIATE</B>

<B>ioctl</B>(2),

as documented in
<B>bpf(4)</B>,

on the descriptor returned by
<B><A HREF='./pcap_fileno.3pcap.html'>pcap_fileno</A>(3PCAP),</B>

after
<B><A HREF='./pcap_activate.3pcap.html'>pcap_activate</A>(3PCAP)</B>

is called;
<DT><DD>
on Solaris 10 and earlier versions of Solaris, immediate mode must be
turned on by using a read timeout of 0 when opening the device (this
will not provide immediate delivery of packets on other platforms, so
don't assume it's sufficient);
<DT><DD>
on Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX, immediate mode must be turned on by doing a
<B>BIOCMBIC</B>

<B>ioctl</B>,

as documented in
<B>packetfilter(7)</B>,

to clear the
<B>ENBATCH</B>

flag on the descriptor returned by
<B><A HREF='./pcap_fileno.3pcap.html'>pcap_fileno</A>(3PCAP),</B>

after
<B><A HREF='./pcap_activate.3pcap.html'>pcap_activate</A>(3PCAP)</B>

is called;
<DT><DD>
on Windows, immediate mode must be turned on by calling
<B>pcap_setmintocopy()</B>

with a size of 0.
</DL>
<P>

On Linux, with previous releases of libpcap, capture devices are always
in immediate mode; however, in 1.5.0 and later, they are, by default,
<B>not</B>

in immediate mode, so if
<B>pcap_set_immediate_mode()</B>

is available, it should be used.
<P>

On other platforms, capture devices are always in immediate mode.
