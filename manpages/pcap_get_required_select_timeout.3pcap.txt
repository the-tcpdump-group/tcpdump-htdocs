NAME
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout  -  get  a  file descriptor on which a
       select() can be done for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       struct timeval *pcap_get_required_select_timeout(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout() returns, on UNIX,  a  pointer  to  a
       struct  timeval  containing  a  value  that must be used as the minimum
       timeout in  select(),  poll(),  epoll_wait(),  and  kevent()  calls  if
       pcap_get_selectable_fd() returns -1.

       The  timeout  that should be used in those calls must be no larger than
       the smallest of all timeouts returned by pcap_get_required_select_time-
       out() for devices from which packets will be captured.

       The  device  for which pcap_get_selectable_fd() returned -1 must be put
       in non-blocking mode  with  pcap_setnonblock(),  and  an  attempt  must
       always  be  made  to  read  packets  from the device when the select(),
       poll(), epoll_wait(), or kevent() call returns.

       Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking may, on
       some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer time-
       out has expired.  A call  to  pcap_dispatch()  or  pcap_next_ex()  will
       return 0 in this case, but will not block.

       pcap_get_required_select_timeout() is not available on Windows.

RETURN VALUE
       A  pointer  to a struct timeval is returned if the timeout is required;
       otherwise NULL is returned.
