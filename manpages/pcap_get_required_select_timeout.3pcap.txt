PCAP_GET_REQUIRED_SELECT_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)PCAP_GET_REQUIRED_SELECT_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout  - get a timeout to be used when doing
       select() for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       const struct timeval *pcap_get_required_select_timeout(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout() returns, on UNIX,  a  pointer  to  a
       struct  timeval  containing  a  value  that must be used as the minimum
       timeout in select(2), poll(2), epoll_wait(2), and kevent(2)  calls,  or
       NULL  if there is no such timeout.  If a non-NULL value is returned, it
       must  be  used  regardless  of  whether   pcap_get_selectable_fd(3PCAP)
       returns  -1  for  any  descriptor  on which those calls are being done.
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout() should be  called  for  all  pcap_ts
       before  a  call to select(), poll(), epoll_wait(), or kevent(), and any
       timeouts used for those calls should be updated  as  appropriate  given
       the new value of the timeout.

       For  kevent(), one EVFILT_TIMER filter per selectable descriptor can be
       used, rather than using  the  timeout  argument  to  kevent();  if  the
       EVFILT_TIMER  event  for  a particular selectable descriptor signals an
       event, pcap_dispatch(3PCAP) should  be  called  for  the  corresponding
       pcap_t.

       On  Linux  systems  with timerfd_create(2), one timer object created by
       timerfd_create() per selectable descriptor can  be  used,  rather  than
       using  the  timeout argument to epoll_wait(); if the timer object for a
       particular selectable descriptor signals an event, pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)
       should be called for the corresponding pcap_t.

       Otherwise,  a timeout value no larger than the smallest of all timeouts
       returned by pcap_get_required_select_timeout() for devices  from  which
       packets  will be captured and any other timeouts to be used in the call
       should be used as the timeout for the call, and, when the call returns,
       pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)  should be called for all pcap_ts for which a non-
       NULL timeout was returned, regardless of whether it's indicated as hav-
       ing anything to read from it or not.

       All  devices  with  a non-NULL timeout must be put in non-blocking mode
       with pcap_setnonblock(3PCAP).

       Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking may, on
       some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer time-
       out has expired.  A call to pcap_dispatch() or pcap_next_ex(3PCAP) will
       return 0 in this case, but will not block.

       pcap_get_required_select_timeout() is not available on Windows.

RETURN VALUE
       A  pointer  to a struct timeval is returned if the timeout is required;
       otherwise NULL is returned.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.   In  previous
       releases,  select(),  poll(), epoll_wait(), and kevent() cannot be used
       on any capture source for which pcap_get_selectable_fd() returns -1.

       In libpcap release 1.10.0 and later, the timeout value can change  from
       call  to  call,  so  pcap_get_required_select_timeout()  must be called
       before each call to select(), poll(), epoll_wait(),  or  kevent(),  and
       the  new  value  must be used to calculate timeouts for the call.  Code
       that does that will also work with  libpcap  1.9.x  releases,  so  code
       using  pcap_get_required_select_timeout()  should be changed to call it
       for each call to select(), poll(), epoll_wait(), or  kevent()  even  if
       the code must also work with libpcap 1.9.x.
