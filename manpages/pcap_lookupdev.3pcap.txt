PCAP_LOOKUPDEV(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_LOOKUPDEV(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_lookupdev - find the default device on which to capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       [DEPRECATED] char *pcap_lookupdev(char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       This  interface is obsoleted by pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP).  To find a de-
       fault device on which to capture, call pcap_findalldevs() and,  if  the
       list  it  returns  is not empty, use the first device in the list.  (If
       the list is empty, there are no devices on which capture is possible.)

       If pcap_init(3PCAP) has been  called,  this  interface  always  returns
       NULL.

       pcap_lookupdev()  returns  a  pointer  to a string giving the name of a
       network  device  suitable   for   use   with   pcap_create(3PCAP)   and
       pcap_activate(3PCAP),   or   with   pcap_open_live(3PCAP),   and   with
       pcap_lookupnet(3PCAP).  If there is an error,  or  if  pcap_init(3PCAP)
       has  been  called, NULL is returned and errbuf is filled in with an ap-
       propriate error message.  errbuf is assumed to be able to hold at least
       PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.

SEE ALSO
       pcap(3PCAP)

BUGS
       The  pointer  returned  by  pcap_lookupdev() points to a static buffer;
       subsequent calls to pcap_lookupdev() in the same thread,  or  calls  to
       pcap_lookupdev() in another thread, may overwrite that buffer.

       In  WinPcap  and Npcap, this function may return a UTF-16 string rather
       than an ASCII or UTF-8 string.
