PCAP_FILENO(3PCAP)                                          PCAP_FILENO(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_fileno - get the file descriptor for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_fileno(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       If  p refers to a network device that was opened for a live capture us-
       ing a combination of pcap_create(3PCAP)  and  pcap_activate(3PCAP),  or
       using  pcap_open_live(3PCAP), pcap_fileno() returns the file descriptor
       from which captured packets are read.

       If p refers to a ``savefile'' that was opened using functions  such  as
       pcap_open_offline(3PCAP)   or   pcap_fopen_offline(3PCAP),  a  ``dead''
       pcap_t opened using pcap_open_dead(3PCAP), or a pcap_t that was created
       with  pcap_create() but that has not yet been activated with pcap_acti-
       vate(), it returns PCAP_ERROR.
