DESCRIPTION
       pcap_freecode()  is  used  to  free up allocated memory pointed to by a
       bpf_program struct generated by pcap_compile() when that BPF program is
       no longer needed, for example after it has been made the filter program
       for a pcap structure by a call to pcap_setfilter().
