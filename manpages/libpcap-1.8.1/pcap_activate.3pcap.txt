PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)                                      PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_activate()  is used to activate a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network, with the options that were set  on  the  handle
       being in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_activate() returns 0 on success without warnings, a non-zero posi-
       tive value on success with warnings, and a negative value on error.   A
       non-zero  return  value  indicates  what warning or error condition oc-
       curred.

       The possible warning values are:

       PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP
              Promiscuous mode was requested, but the capture  source  doesn't
              support promiscuous mode.

       PCAP_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP
              The    time    stamp    type    specified    in    a    previous
              pcap_set_tstamp_type()  call  isn't  supported  by  the  capture
              source (the time stamp type is left as the default),

       PCAP_WARNING
              Another  warning  condition occurred; pcap_geterr() or pcap_per-
              ror() may be called with p as an argument to fetch or display  a
              message describing the warning condition.

       The possible error values are:

       PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED
              The handle has already been activated.

       PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE
              The capture source specified when the handle was created doesn't
              exist.

       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED
              The process doesn't have permission to open the capture source.

       PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED
              The process has  permission  to  open  the  capture  source  but
              doesn't have permission to put it into promiscuous mode.

       PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP
              Monitor  mode  was specified but the capture source doesn't sup-
              port monitor mode.

       PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP
              The capture source device is not up.

       PCAP_ERROR
              Another error occurred.  pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror()  may  be
              called  with  p as an argument to fetch or display a message de-
              scribing the error.

       If PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP, PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE, or  PCAP_ER-
       ROR_PERM_DENIED  is  returned,  pcap_geterr()  or  pcap_perror() may be
       called with p as an argument to fetch or display an message giving  ad-
       ditional  details  about the problem that might be useful for debugging
       the problem if it's unexpected.

       Additional warning and error codes may be added in the future;  a  pro-
       gram  should  check  for positive, negative, and zero return codes, and
       treat all positive return codes as warnings  and  all  negative  return
       codes  as  errors.  pcap_statustostr() can be called, with a warning or
       error code as an argument, to fetch a message describing the warning or
       error code.
