<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_activate()</B>

is used to activate a packet capture handle to look
at packets on the network, with the options that were set on the handle
being in effect.
<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_activate()</B>

returns 0 on success without warnings, a non-zero positive value on
success with warnings, and a negative value on error.
A non-zero return value indicates what warning or error condition
occurred.
<P>

The possible warning values are:
<DL>
<DT><B>PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP</B>

<DD>
Promiscuous mode was requested, but the capture source doesn't support
promiscuous mode.
<DT><B>PCAP_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP</B>

<DD>
The time stamp type specified in a previous
<B>pcap_set_tstamp_type()</B>

call isn't supported by the capture source (the time stamp type is
left as the default),
<DT><B>PCAP_WARNING</B>

<DD>
Another warning condition occurred;
<B>pcap_geterr()</B>

or
<B>pcap_perror()</B>

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display a message describing the warning
condition.
</DL>
<P>

The possible error values are:
<DL>
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED</B>

<DD>
The handle has already been activated.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</B>

<DD>
The capture source specified when the handle was created doesn't
exist.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED</B>

<DD>
The process doesn't have permission to open the capture source.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED</B>

<DD>
The process has permission to open the capture source but doesn't
have permission to put it into promiscuous mode.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP</B>

<DD>
Monitor mode was specified but the capture source doesn't support
monitor mode.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP</B>

<DD>
The capture source device is not up.
<DT><B>PCAP_ERROR</B>

<DD>
Another error occurred.
<B>pcap_geterr()</B>

or
<B>pcap_perror()</B>

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display a message describing the error.
</DL>
<P>

If
<B>PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP</B>,

<B>PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</B>,

or
<B>PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED</B>

is returned,
<B>pcap_geterr()</B>

or
<B>pcap_perror()</B>

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display an message giving additional details
about the problem that might be useful for debugging the problem if it's
unexpected.
<P>

Additional warning and error codes may be added in the future; a program
should check for positive, negative, and zero return codes, and treat
all positive return codes as warnings and all negative return
codes as errors.
<B>pcap_statustostr()</B>

can be called, with a warning or error code as an argument, to fetch a
message describing the warning or error code.
