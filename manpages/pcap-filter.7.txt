PCAP-FILTER(7)         Miscellaneous Information Manual         PCAP-FILTER(7)

NAME
       pcap-filter - packet filter syntax

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_compile(3PCAP)  is used to compile a string into a filter program.
       The resulting filter program can then be  applied  to  some  stream  of
       packets    to   determine   which   packets   will   be   supplied   to
       pcap_loop(3PCAP),    pcap_dispatch(3PCAP),     pcap_next(3PCAP),     or
       pcap_next_ex(3PCAP).

       The  filter  expression consists of one or more primitives.  Primitives
       usually consist of an id (name or number) preceded by one or more qual-
       ifiers.  There are three different kinds of qualifier:

       type   type  qualifiers  say  what  kind of thing the id name or number
              refers to.  Possible types are host, net,  port  and  portrange.
              E.g., `host foo', `net 128.3', `port 20', `portrange 6000-6008'.
              If there is no type qualifier, host is assumed.

       dir    dir qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or
              from  id.  Possible directions are src, dst, src or dst, src and
              dst, ra, ta, addr1, addr2, addr3, and addr4.  E.g.,  `src  foo',
              `dst net 128.3', `src or dst port ftp-data'.  If there is no dir
              qualifier, `src or dst' is assumed.  The ra, ta,  addr1,  addr2,
              addr3, and addr4 qualifiers are only valid for IEEE 802.11 Wire-
              less LAN link layers.

       proto  proto qualifiers restrict the match to  a  particular  protocol.
              Possible  protocols  are:  ether,  fddi, tr, wlan, ip, ip6, arp,
              rarp, decnet, sctp, tcp and udp.  E.g., `ether  src  foo',  `arp
              net  128.3',  `tcp  port  21',  `udp portrange 7000-7009', `wlan
              addr2 0:2:3:4:5:6'.  If there is no proto qualifier, all  proto-
              cols  consistent  with  the  type  are assumed.  E.g., `src foo'
              means `(ip6 or ip or arp or rarp) src foo', `net bar' means `(ip
              or  arp  or  rarp)  net bar' and `port 53' means `(tcp or udp or
              sctp) port 53' (note that these examples use invalid  syntax  to
              illustrate the principle).

       [fddi  is  actually  an alias for ether; the parser treats them identi-
       cally as meaning ``the data link level used on  the  specified  network
       interface''.  FDDI headers contain Ethernet-like source and destination
       addresses, and often contain Ethernet-like packet  types,  so  you  can
       filter on these FDDI fields just as with the analogous Ethernet fields.
       FDDI headers also contain other fields, but you cannot  name  them  ex-
       plicitly in a filter expression.

       Similarly,  tr and wlan are aliases for ether; the previous paragraph's
       statements about FDDI headers also apply to Token Ring and 802.11 wire-
       less  LAN  headers.  For 802.11 headers, the destination address is the
       DA field and the source address is the SA field; the BSSID, RA, and  TA
       fields aren't tested.]

       In  addition  to the above, there are some special `primitive' keywords
       that don't follow the pattern: gateway, broadcast,  less,  greater  and
       arithmetic expressions.  All of these are described below.

       More complex filter expressions are built up by using the words and, or
       and not (or equivalently: `&&', `||' and `!' respectively)  to  combine
       primitives.   E.g.,  `host foo and not port ftp and not port ftp-data'.
       To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.   E.g.,  `tcp
       dst  port  ftp  or  ftp-data or domain' is exactly the same as `tcp dst
       port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain'.

       Allowable primitives are:

       dst host hostnameaddr
              True if the IPv4/v6 destination field of  the  packet  is  host-
              nameaddr, which may be either an address or a name.

       src host hostnameaddr
              True if the IPv4/v6 source field of the packet is hostnameaddr.

       host hostnameaddr
              True  if  either the IPv4/v6 source or destination of the packet
              is hostnameaddr.

              Any of the above host expressions can be prepended with the key-
              words, ip, arp, rarp, or ip6 as in:
                   ip host hostnameaddr
              which is equivalent to:
                   ether proto \ip and host hostnameaddr
              If  hostnameaddr is a name with multiple IPv4/v6 addresses, each
              address will be checked for a match.

       ether dst ethernameaddr
              True if the Ethernet destination address is ethernameaddr.  eth-
              ernameaddr  may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a numerical
              MAC     address     of     the     form     "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx",
              "xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx",  "xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx",  "xxxx.xxxx.xxxx"  or
              "xxxxxxxxxxxx", where each "x" is a hex digit (0-9, a-f,  or  A-
              F).

       ether src ethernameaddr
              True if the Ethernet source address is ethernameaddr.

       ether host ethernameaddr
              True  if  either  the  Ethernet source or destination address is
              ethernameaddr.

       gateway host
              True if the packet used host as a gateway.  I.e.,  the  Ethernet
              source or destination address was host but neither the IP source
              nor the IP destination was host.  Host must be a name  and  must
              be  found  both by the machine's host-name-to-IP-address resolu-
              tion mechanisms (host name file, DNS, NIS, etc.) and by the  ma-
              chine's   host-name-to-Ethernet-address   resolution   mechanism
              (/etc/ethers, etc.).  (An equivalent expression is
                   ether host ethernameaddr and not host hostnameaddr
              which can be used with either names or numbers for  hostnameaddr
              /  ethernameaddr.)   This  syntax  does not work in IPv6-enabled
              configuration at this moment.

       dst net netnameaddr
              True if the IPv4/v6 destination address of the packet has a net-
              work  number  of netnameaddr.  Net may be either a name from the
              networks database (/etc/networks, etc.) or a network number.  An
              IPv4  network  number  can  be  written  as a dotted quad (e.g.,
              192.168.1.0), dotted triple (e.g., 192.168.1), dotted pair (e.g,
              172.16),   or   single   number   (e.g.,  10);  the  netmask  is
              255.255.255.255 for a dotted quad (which means that it's  really
              a  host  match),  255.255.255.0 for a dotted triple, 255.255.0.0
              for a dotted pair, or 255.0.0.0 for a single  number.   An  IPv6
              network  number  must  be  written  out  fully;  the  netmask is
              ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,   so   IPv6   "network"
              matches  are really always host matches, and a network match re-
              quires a netmask length.

       src net netnameaddr
              True if the IPv4/v6 source address of the packet has  a  network
              number of netnameaddr.

       net netnameaddr
              True  if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination address of the
              packet has a network number of netnameaddr.

       net netaddr mask netmask
              True if the IPv4 address matches netaddr with the specific  net-
              mask.   May be qualified with src or dst.  Note that this syntax
              is not valid for IPv6 netaddr.

       net netaddr/len
              True if the IPv4/v6 address matches netaddr with a  netmask  len
              bits wide.  May be qualified with src or dst.

       dst port portnamenum
              True  if the packet is IPv4/v6 TCP, UDP or SCTP and has a desti-
              nation port value of portnamenum.  The portnamenum can be a num-
              ber  or  a name used in /etc/services (see tcp(4P) and udp(4P)).
              If a name is  used,  both  the  port  number  and  protocol  are
              checked.   If  a number or ambiguous name is used, only the port
              number is checked (e.g., `dst port 513' will print both  tcp/lo-
              gin  traffic  and  udp/who traffic, and `port domain' will print
              both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).

       src port portnamenum
              True if the packet has a source port value of portnamenum.

       port portnamenum
              True if either the source or destination port of the  packet  is
              portnamenum.

       dst portrange portnamenum1-portnamenum2
              True  if the packet is IPv4/v6 TCP, UDP or SCTP and has a desti-
              nation port value between portnamenum1  and  portnamenum2  (both
              inclusive).   portnamenum1  and  portnamenum2 are interpreted in
              the same fashion as the portnamenum parameter for port.

       src portrange portnamenum1-portnamenum2
              True if the packet has a source port value between  portnamenum1
              and portnamenum2 (both inclusive).

       portrange portnamenum1-portnamenum2
              True  if  either the source or destination port of the packet is
              between portnamenum1 and portnamenum2 (both inclusive).

              Any of the above port or port range expressions can be prepended
              with the keywords, tcp, udp or sctp, as in:
                   tcp src port portnamenum
              which matches only TCP packets whose source port is portnamenum.

       less length
              True  if  the  packet has a length less than or equal to length.
              This is equivalent to:
                   len <= length

       greater length
              True if the packet has a length greater than or equal to length.
              This is equivalent to:
                   len >= length

       ip proto protocol
              True  if  the  packet is an IPv4 packet (see ip(4P)) of protocol
              type protocol.  Protocol can be a number or  one  of  the  names
              recognized  by  getprotobyname(3),  for  example: ah, esp, eigrp
              (only in Linux with glibc, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly  BSD,  and
              macOS), icmp, igmp, igrp (only in Haiku and OpenBSD), pim, sctp,
              tcp, udp or vrrp.  Note that most of these  example  identifiers
              are  also  keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\).  Note
              that this primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.

              Typically getprotobyname(3) parses the  /etc/protocols  file  to
              translate  protocol  names  to numbers, and the getent protocols
              command lists the protocols recognised by the function.  This is
              not  entirely so in AIX (which does not have the command), Haiku
              (which has the file at /system/data/network/protocols  and  does
              not have the command), on Linux with musl libc (which hard-codes
              the list of protocols) and on hosts that use a network  database
              to resolve protocol names to numbers (see nsswitch.conf(5)).  If
              a protocol name fails to translate to a number, this version  of
              libpcap will treat the filter expression as invalid.

       carp, vrrp
              Abbreviations for:
                   ip proto 112

       icmp   Abbreviation for:
                   ip proto 1

       igmp   Abbreviation for:
                   ip proto 2

       igrp   Abbreviation for:
                   ip proto 9

       ip6 proto protocol
              True  if the packet is an IPv6 packet of protocol type protocol.
              (See `ip proto' above for the meaning of protocol.)   Note  that
              the IPv6 variant of ICMP uses a different protocol number, named
              ipv6-icmp in AIX,  FreeBSD,  illumos,  Haiku,  GNU/Hurd,  Linux,
              macOS,  NetBSD,  OpenBSD,  Solaris  and Windows.  Note that this
              primitive does not chase the protocol header chain.

       icmp6  Abbreviation for:
                   ip6 proto 58

       proto protocol
              True if the packet is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet  of  protocol  type
              protocol.   (See  `ip proto' above for the meaning of protocol.)
              Note that this primitive does  not  chase  the  protocol  header
              chain.

       ah, esp, pim, sctp, tcp, udp
              Abbreviations for:
                   proto \protocol
              where protocol is one of the above protocols.

       ip6 protochain protocol
              True  if the packet is IPv6 packet, and contains protocol header
              with type protocol in  its  protocol  header  chain.   (See  `ip
              proto' above for the meaning of protocol.)  For example,
                   ip6 protochain 6
              matches any IPv6 packet with TCP protocol header in the protocol
              header chain.  The packet may contain, for example,  authentica-
              tion  header,  routing  header, or hop-by-hop option header, be-
              tween IPv6 header and TCP header.  The BPF code emitted by  this
              primitive  is  complex  and cannot be optimized by the BPF opti-
              mizer code, and is not supported by filter engines in  the  ker-
              nel, so this can be somewhat slow, and may cause more packets to
              be dropped.

       ip protochain protocol
              Equivalent to ip6 protochain protocol, but  this  is  for  IPv4.
              (See `ip proto' above for the meaning of protocol.)

       protochain protocol
              True  if  the  packet is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet of protocol type
              protocol.  (See `ip proto' above for the meaning  of  protocol.)
              Note that this primitive chases the protocol header chain.

       ether broadcast
              True  if  the packet is an Ethernet broadcast packet.  The ether
              keyword is optional.

       ip broadcast
              True if the packet is an IPv4 broadcast packet.  It  checks  for
              both  the  all-zeroes  and  all-ones  broadcast conventions, and
              looks up the subnet mask on the interface on which  the  capture
              is being done.

              If  the subnet mask of the interface on which the capture is be-
              ing done is not available, either because the interface on which
              capture  is  being done has no netmask or because the capture is
              being done on the Linux "any" interface, which  can  capture  on
              more than one interface, this check will not work correctly.

       ether multicast
              True  if  the packet is an Ethernet multicast packet.  The ether
              keyword is optional.  This is shorthand for `ether[0] & 1 != 0'.

       ip multicast
              True if the packet is an IPv4 multicast packet.

       ip6 multicast
              True if the packet is an IPv6 multicast packet.

       ether proto protocol
              True if the packet is of ether type protocol.  Protocol can be a
              number  or  one  of the names aarp, arp, atalk, decnet, ip, ip6,
              ipx, iso, lat, loopback, mopdl, moprc,  netbeui,  rarp,  sca  or
              stp.  Note these identifiers (except loopback) are also keywords
              and must be escaped via backslash (\).

              [In the case of FDDI  (e.g.,  `fddi  proto  \arp'),  Token  Ring
              (e.g.,  `tr  proto  \arp'), and IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (e.g.,
              `wlan proto \arp'), for most of those  protocols,  the  protocol
              identification  comes  from the 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC)
              header, which is usually layered on top of the FDDI, Token Ring,
              or 802.11 header.

              When  filtering  for  most  protocol  identifiers on FDDI, Token
              Ring, or 802.11, the filter checks only the protocol ID field of
              an  LLC  header  in so-called SNAP format with an Organizational
              Unit Identifier (OUI) of 0x000000, for encapsulated Ethernet; it
              doesn't  check  whether the packet is in SNAP format with an OUI
              of 0x000000.  The exceptions are:

              iso    the filter checks the DSAP  (Destination  Service  Access
                     Point)  and  SSAP (Source Service Access Point) fields of
                     the LLC header;

              stp and netbeui
                     the filter checks the DSAP of the LLC header;

              atalk  the filter checks for a SNAP-format packet with an OUI of
                     0x080007 and the AppleTalk etype.

              In  the  case  of  Ethernet, the filter checks the Ethernet type
              field for most of those protocols.  The exceptions are:

              iso, stp, and netbeui
                     the filter checks for an 802.3 frame and then checks  the
                     LLC header as it does for FDDI, Token Ring, and 802.11;

              atalk  the filter checks both for the AppleTalk etype in an Eth-
                     ernet frame and for a SNAP-format packet as it  does  for
                     FDDI, Token Ring, and 802.11;

              but not in control frames.

       wlan addr4 ehost
              True if the fourth IEEE 802.11 address, if  present,  is  ehost.
              The  fourth address field is only used for WDS (Wireless Distri-
              bution System) frames.

       wlan type wlan_type
              True if  the  IEEE  802.11  frame  type  matches  the  specified
              wlan_type.   Valid  wlan_types are: mgt, ctl and data.  The wlan
              keyword is optional.

       wlan type wlan_type subtype wlan_subtype
              True if  the  IEEE  802.11  frame  type  matches  the  specified
              wlan_type  and frame subtype matches the specified wlan_subtype.
              The wlan keyword is optional.

              If the specified wlan_type is mgt, then valid wlan_subtypes are:
              assoc-req,  assoc-resp,  reassoc-req,  reassoc-resp,  probe-req,
              probe-resp, beacon, atim, disassoc, auth and deauth.

              If the specified wlan_type is ctl, then valid wlan_subtypes are:
              bar, ba, ps-poll, rts, cts, ack, cf-end and cf-end-ack.

              If  the  specified  wlan_type  is data, then valid wlan_subtypes
              are: data, data-cf-ack,  data-cf-poll,  data-cf-ack-poll,  null,
              cf-ack,   cf-poll,   cf-ack-poll,   qos-data,   qos-data-cf-ack,
              qos-data-cf-poll,  qos-data-cf-ack-poll,  qos,  qos-cf-poll  and
              qos-cf-ack-poll.

       wlan subtype wlan_subtype
              True  if  the  IEEE  802.11  frame subtype matches the specified
              wlan_subtype and frame has  the  type  to  which  the  specified
              wlan_subtype belongs.  The wlan keyword is optional.

       wlan dir direction
              True  if  the  IEEE 802.11 frame direction matches the specified
              direction.  Valid directions are: nods, tods, fromds, dstods, or
              a numeric value.  The wlan keyword is optional.

       vlan [vlan_id]
              True  if  the  packet is an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN packet.  If the op-
              tional vlan_id is specified, only true if  the  packet  has  the
              specified vlan_id.  Note that the first vlan keyword encountered
              in an expression changes the decoding offsets for the  remainder
              of  the  expression  on the assumption that the packet is a VLAN
              packet.  The `vlan [vlan_id]` keyword  may  be  used  more  than
              once,  to  filter on VLAN hierarchies.  Each use of that keyword
              increments the filter offsets by 4.

              For example:
                   vlan 100 && vlan 200
              filters on VLAN 200 encapsulated within VLAN 100, and
                   vlan && vlan 300 && ip
              filters IPv4 protocol  encapsulated  in  VLAN  300  encapsulated
              within any higher order VLAN.

       mpls [label_num]
              True if the packet is an MPLS packet.  If the optional label_num
              is specified, only true if the  packet  has  the  specified  la-
              bel_num.  Note that the first mpls keyword encountered in an ex-
              pression changes the decoding offsets for the remainder  of  the
              expression  on the assumption that the packet is a MPLS-encapsu-
              lated IP packet.  The `mpls [label_num]`  keyword  may  be  used
              more than once, to filter on MPLS hierarchies.  Each use of that
              keyword increments the filter offsets by 4.

              For example:
                   mpls 100000 && mpls 1024
              filters packets with an outer label of 100000 and an inner label
              of 1024, and
                   mpls && mpls 1024 && host 192.9.200.1
              filters  packets  to  or from 192.9.200.1 with an inner label of
              1024 and any outer label.

       pppoed True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet Discovery packet (Eth-
              ernet type 0x8863).

       pppoes [session_id]
              True if the packet is a PPP-over-Ethernet Session packet (Ether-
              net type 0x8864).  If the optional session_id is specified, only
              true  if the packet has the specified session_id.  Note that the
              first pppoes keyword encountered in an  expression  changes  the
              decoding  offsets for the remainder of the expression on the as-
              sumption that the packet is a PPPoE session packet.

              For example:
                   pppoes 0x27 && ip
              filters IPv4 protocol encapsulated in PPPoE session id 0x27.

       geneve [vni]
              True if the packet is a Geneve packet (UDP port  6081).  If  the
              optional vni is specified, only true if the packet has the spec-
              ified vni.  Note that when the geneve keyword is encountered  in
              an expression, it changes the decoding offsets for the remainder
              of the expression on the assumption that the packet is a  Geneve
              packet.

              For example:
                   geneve 0xb && ip
              filters  IPv4 protocol encapsulated in Geneve with VNI 0xb. This
              will match both IPv4 directly encapsulated in Geneve as well  as
              IPv4 contained inside an Ethernet frame.

       vxlan [vni]
              True if the packet is a VXLAN packet (UDP port 4789). If the op-
              tional vni is specified, only true if the packet has the  speci-
              fied vni.  Note that when the vxlan keyword is encountered in an
              expression, it changes the decoding offsets for the remainder of
              the  expression  on  the  assumption  that the packet is a VXLAN
              packet.

              For example:
                   vxlan 0x7 && ip6
              filters IPv6 protocol encapsulated in VXLAN with VNI 0x7.

       iso proto protocol
              True if the packet is an OSI packet of protocol  type  protocol.
              Protocol  can  be  a  number  or one of the names clnp, esis, or
              isis.

       clnp, esis, isis
              Abbreviations for:
                   iso proto \protocol
              where protocol is one of the above protocols.

       l1, l2, iih, lsp, snp, csnp, psnp
              Abbreviations for IS-IS PDU types.

       vpi n  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, with
              a virtual path identifier of n.

       vci n  True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris, with
              a virtual channel identifier of n.

       lane   True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris,  and
              is an ATM LANE packet.  Note that the first lane keyword encoun-
              tered in an expression changes the tests done in  the  remainder
              of  the expression on the assumption that the packet is either a
              LANE emulated Ethernet packet or a LANE LE Control  packet.   If
              lane  isn't  specified,  the tests are done under the assumption
              that the packet is an LLC-encapsulated packet.

       oamf4sc
              True if the packet is an ATM packet, for SunATM on Solaris,  and

              ceeding, Connect, Release, or Release Done message.

       fisu   True if the packet is a Fill-In Signal Unit (FISU) MTP2 packet.

       lssu   True if the packet is a Link  Status  Signal  Unit  (LSSU)  MTP2

              True if the packet has the Service Information Octet (SIO) field
              of the MTP2 MSU header set to the value  val.   Note  that  this
              keyword does not test whether the packet is an MSU packet.

              True if the packet has the Destination Point Code (DPC) field of
              the MTP3 standard routing label set to the value val.  Note that
              this keyword does not test whether the packet is an MTP3 packet.

       opc val
              True if the packet has the Originating Point Code (OPC) field of
              the MTP3 standard routing label set to the value val.  Note that
              this keyword does not test whether the packet is an MTP3 packet.

       sls val
              True if the packet has the Signalling Link Selection (SLS) field
              of the MTP3 standard routing label set to the value  val.   Note
              that  this  keyword  does not test whether the packet is an MTP3
              packet.

              pressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary  operators  {+,
              -,  *,  /,  %,  &, |, ^, <<, >>}, a length operator, and special
              packet data accessors.  Note that all comparisons are  unsigned,
              so that, for example, 0x80000000 and 0xffffffff are > 0.

              The % and ^ operators are currently only supported for filtering
              in the kernel on  particular  operating  systems  (for  example:
              FreeBSD, Linux with 3.7 and later kernels, NetBSD); on all other
              systems (for example: AIX, Hurd, illumos, Solaris, OpenBSD),  if
              those  operators  are used, filtering will be done in user mode,
              which will increase the overhead of capturing  packets  and  may
              cause more packets to be dropped.

              The  length  operator,  indicated  by the keyword len, gives the
              length of the packet.

              To access data inside the packet, use the following syntax:
                   proto [ expr : size ]
              Proto is one of arp, atalk, carp,  decnet,  ether,  fddi,  icmp,
              icmp6,  igmp,  igrp, ip, ip6, lat, link, mopdl, moprc, pim, ppp,
              radio, rarp, sca, sctp, slip, tcp, tr, udp, vrrp  or  wlan,  and
              indicates  the  protocol layer for the index operation.  (ether,
              fddi, link, ppp, slip, tr and wlan all refer to the link  layer.
              radio  refers  to  the  "radio header" added to some 802.11 cap-
              tures.)  Note that tcp, udp and other upper-layer protocol types
              only apply to IPv4, not IPv6 (this will be fixed in the future).
              The byte offset, relative to the indicated  protocol  layer,  is
              given  by  expr.   Size  is optional and indicates the number of
              bytes in the field of interest; it can be either  one,  two,  or
              four, and defaults to one.

              For  example, `ether[0] & 1 != 0' catches all multicast traffic.
              The expression `ip[0] & 0xf != 5' catches all IPv4 packets  with
              options.  The expression `ip[6:2] & 0x1fff = 0' catches only un-
              fragmented IPv4 datagrams and frag zero of fragmented IPv4 data-
              grams.   This check is implicitly applied to the tcp, udp, icmp,
              sctp, igmp, pim, igrp, vrrp and carp index operations.  For  in-
              stance,  tcp[0]  always  means the first byte of the TCP header,
              and never means the first byte of an intervening fragment.

              Some offsets and field values may be expressed as  names  rather
              than  as  numeric  values.   The following protocol header field
              offsets are available: icmptype  (ICMP  type  field),  icmp6type
              (ICMPv6  type  field),  icmpcode  (ICMP  code  field), icmp6code
              (ICMPv6 code field) and tcpflags (TCP flags field).

              The  following   ICMP   type   field   values   are   available:
              icmp-echoreply,  icmp-unreach, icmp-sourcequench, icmp-redirect,
              icmp-echo, icmp-routeradvert, icmp-routersolicit, icmp-timxceed,
              icmp-paramprob,    icmp-tstamp,   icmp-tstampreply,   icmp-ireq,
              icmp-ireqreply, icmp-maskreq, icmp-maskreply.

              The  following  ICMPv6  type   field   values   are   available:
              icmp6-destinationunreach,                    icmp6-packettoobig,
              icmp6-timeexceeded,     icmp6-parameterproblem,      icmp6-echo,
              icmp6-echoreply,                   icmp6-multicastlistenerquery,
              icmp6-multicastlistenerreportv1,    icmp6-multicastlistenerdone,
              icmp6-routersolicit,  icmp6-routeradvert, icmp6-neighborsolicit,
              icmp6-neighboradvert,     icmp6-redirect,     icmp6-routerrenum,
              icmp6-nodeinformationquery,       icmp6-nodeinformationresponse,
              icmp6-ineighbordiscoverysolicit, icmp6-ineighbordiscoveryadvert,
              icmp6-multicastlistenerreportv2,
              icmp6-homeagentdiscoveryrequest,  icmp6-homeagentdiscoveryreply,
              icmp6-mobileprefixsolicit,             icmp6-mobileprefixadvert,
              icmp6-certpathsolicit,                     icmp6-certpathadvert,
              icmp6-multicastrouteradvert,       icmp6-multicastroutersolicit,
              icmp6-multicastrouterterm.

              The following TCP flags field  values  are  available:  tcp-fin,
              tcp-syn, tcp-rst, tcp-push, tcp-ack, tcp-urg, tcp-ece, tcp-cwr.

       Primitives may be combined using:

              A parenthesized group of primitives and operators.

              Negation (`!' or `not').

              Concatenation (`&&' or `and').

              Alternation (`||' or `or').

       Negation  has  the  highest  precedence.  Alternation and concatenation
       have equal precedence and associate left to right.

       If an identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent keyword is
       assumed.  For example,
            not host vs and ace
       is short for
            not host vs and host ace
       which should not be confused with
            not (host vs or ace)

EXAMPLES
       To select all packets arriving at or departing from `sundown':
              host sundown

       To select traffic between `helios' and either `hot' or `ace':
              host helios and (hot or ace)

       To select all IPv4 packets between `ace' and any host except `helios':
              ip host ace and not helios

       To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at Berkeley:
              net ucb-ether

       To select all FTP traffic through Internet gateway `snup':
              gateway snup and (port ftp or ftp-data)

       To  select  IPv4  traffic  neither  sourced from nor destined for local
       hosts (if you gateway to one other net, this stuff should never make it
       onto your local net).
              ip and not net localnet

       To  select  the start and end packets (the SYN and FIN packets) of each
       TCP conversation that involves a non-local host.
              tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net localnet

       To select the TCP packets with flags RST and ACK both set.   (i.e.  se-
       lect  only  the RST and ACK flags in the flags field, and if the result
       is "RST and ACK both set", match)
              tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-rst|tcp-ack) == (tcp-rst|tcp-ack)

       To select all IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80,  i.e.  print  only
       packets  that  contain  data, not, for example, SYN and FIN packets and
       ACK-only packets.  (IPv6 is left as an exercise for the reader.)
              tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)

       To select IPv4 packets longer  than  576  bytes  sent  through  gateway
       `snup':
              gateway snup and ip[2:2] > 576

       To  select  IPv4  broadcast or multicast packets that were not sent via
       Ethernet broadcast or multicast:
              ether[0] & 1 = 0 and ip[16] >= 224

       To select all ICMP packets that are not  echo  requests/replies  (i.e.,
       not ping packets):
              icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echo and icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echoreply
              icmp6[icmp6type] != icmp6-echo and icmp6[icmp6type] != icmp6-echoreply

       Filter expressions on fields other than those  in  Token  Ring  headers
       will not correctly handle source-routed Token Ring packets.

       Filter  expressions  on  fields other than those in 802.11 headers will
       not correctly handle 802.11 data packets with both To DS  and  From  DS
       set.

       `ip6  proto' should chase header chain, but at this moment it does not.
       `ip6 protochain' is supplied for this behavior.  For example, to  match
       IPv6 fragments: `ip6 protochain 44'

       Arithmetic  expression  against  transport  layer headers, like tcp[0],
       does not work against IPv6 packets.  It only looks at IPv4 packets.
