PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)                                PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_timeout - set the read timeout for a not-yet-activated capture
       handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_timeout(pcap_t *p, int to_ms);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_timeout() sets the read timeout that will be used on a capture
       handle when the handle is activated to to_ms, which is in units of mil-
       liseconds.

       The behavior, if the timeout isn't specified, is undefined.  We  recom-
       mend  always  setting  the timeout to a non-zero value unless immediate
       mode is set, in which case the timeout has no effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_timeout() returns 0  on  success  or  PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED  if
       called on a capture handle that has been activated.
