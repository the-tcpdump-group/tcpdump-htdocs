NAME
       pcap_snapshot - get the snapshot length

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_snapshot(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_snapshot()    returns   the   snapshot   length   specified   when
       pcap_set_snaplen(3PCAP) or pcap_open_live(3PCAP) was called, for a live
       capture, or the snapshot length from the capture file,  for  a  ``save-
       file''.

       It   must   not   be   called   on   a   pcap   descriptor  created  by
       pcap_create(3PCAP)   that   has   not    yet    been    activated    by
       pcap_activate(3PCAP).

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_snapshot()  returns  the  snapshot  length on success and PCAP_ER-
       ROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if called on a capture handle that has  been  created
       but not activated.
