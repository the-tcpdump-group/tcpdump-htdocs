PCAP_SETNONBLOCK(3PCAP)                                PCAP_SETNONBLOCK(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_setnonblock, pcap_getnonblock - set or get the state of non-block-
       ing mode on a capture device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_setnonblock(pcap_t *p, int nonblock, char *errbuf);
       int pcap_getnonblock(pcap_t *p, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_setnonblock() puts a capture handle into ``non-blocking'' mode, or
       takes  it  out  of ``non-blocking'' mode, depending on whether the non-
       block argument is non-zero or zero.  It has no effect on ``savefiles''.
       If  there  is  an error, PCAP_ERROR is returned and errbuf is filled in
       with an appropriate error message; otherwise, 0 is returned.

       In ``non-blocking'' mode, an attempt to read from the capture  descrip-
       tor with pcap_dispatch(3PCAP) and pcap_next_ex(3PCAP) will, if no pack-
       ets are currently available to be read,  return  0  immediately  rather
       than blocking waiting for packets to arrive.

       pcap_loop(3PCAP)  will loop forever, consuming CPU time when no packets
       are  currently  available;  pacp_dispatch()  should  be  used  instead.
       pcap_next(3PCAP)  will  return  NULL  if there are no packets currently
       available  to  read;  this  is  indistinguishable  from  an  error,  so
       pcap_next_ex() should be used instead.

       When   first   activated   with  pcap_activate(3PCAP)  or  opened  with
       pcap_open_live(3PCAP),  a  capture  handle  is  not  in  ``non-blocking
       mode'';  a  call  to  pcap_setnonblock() is required in order to put it
       into ``non-blocking'' mode.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_getnonblock() returns the current ``non-blocking''  state  of  the
       capture  descriptor; it always returns 0 on ``savefiles''.  If there is
       an error, PCAP_ERROR is returned and errbuf is filled in with an appro-
       priate error message.

       errbuf is assumed to be able to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
