PCAP_OPEN_LIVE(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_OPEN_LIVE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_open_live - open a device for capturing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_open_live(const char *device, int snaplen,
               int promisc, int to_ms, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_open_live()  is  used to obtain a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.  device is a string that specifies the  network
       device  to  open;  on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device
       argument of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from  all  in-
       terfaces.

       snaplen specifies the snapshot length to be set on the handle.

       promisc specifies if the interface is to be put into promiscuous mode.

       to_ms specifies the read timeout in milliseconds.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_open_live() returns a pcap_t * on success and NULL on failure.  If
       NULL is returned, errbuf is filled in with an  appropriate  error  mes-
       sage.   errbuf  may  also  be set to warning text when pcap_open_live()
       succeeds; to detect this case the caller  should  store  a  zero-length
       string  in errbuf before calling pcap_open_live() and display the warn-
       ing to the user if errbuf is no longer a zero-length string.  errbuf is
       assumed to be able to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
