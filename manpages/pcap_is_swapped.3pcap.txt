PCAP_IS_SWAPPED(3PCAP)                                  PCAP_IS_SWAPPED(3PCAP)



NAME
       pcap_is_swapped - find out whether a savefile has the native byte order

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_is_swapped(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_is_swapped()  returns  true (1) if p refers to a ``savefile'' that
       uses a different byte order than the current system.  For a  live  cap-
       ture, it always returns false (0).

       It  must  not  be  called on a pcap descriptor created by pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_datalink()  returns  true  (1)  or  false  (0)  on   success   and
       PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if  called  on a capture handle that has been
       created but not activated.
