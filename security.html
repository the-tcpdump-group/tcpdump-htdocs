                          participates</a> in MITRE's CVE Program as a CNA (CVE

                          and libpcap vulnerabilities.  Any involvement with
                          vulnerabilities in other software can be considered on
                          a case by case basis only if the software is closely
                          related to packet capture and analysis and if the case
                          does not belong to the scope of another CNA.

                          Vulnerabilities reported to The Tcpdump Group via
                          <a href="mailto:security@tcpdump.org">security@tcpdump.org</a>
                          will be disclosed to the
                          public at the next release of tcpdump.

                        <p>
                          As a volunteer run open source organization, The
                          Tcpdump Group can not promise to release within a set
                          period like 90 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Tcpdump Group aims to release twice a year,
                          usually in March and November of each year.  This
                          is a best effort commitment.  We will attempt to
                          ship more often but this will depend upon
                          availability of volunteer time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Each release will do its best to credit the
                          reporter with the identifying of the vulnerability.
                          Each reported issue will be given a CVE number at
                          the time of reporting.  You can find a list of the most
                          recently processed CVEs <a href="public-cve-list.txt">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Bug reports should include a sample pcap (or
                          pcapng) file that demonstrates the problem.
                          An effort will be made to keep the sample file
                          confidential until the bug has been fixed. Once
                          fixed, the sample file is expected to be released
                          publicly as part of a test case.
