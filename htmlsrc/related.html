                                features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link

                                functionality.  Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
                                applications can be whipped up with little effort.

                                rewritten since then with hundreds of releases improving Npcap's
                                speed, portability, security, and efficiency.

                                pcapfix is a repair tool for corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It checks
                                for an intact pcap global header and packet block and repairs it if there
                                are any corrupted bytes. If a header is not present, one is created and
                                added to the beginning of the file. It then tries to find pcap packet
                                headers or packet blocks, and checks and repairs them.

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
                                connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.

                                Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source, Unix-based Network Intrusion
                                Detection System (NIDS) that passively monitors
                                network traffic and looks for suspicious activity.
                                Zeek detects intrusions by first parsing network
                                traffic to extract its application-level semantics
                                and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
                                compare the activity with patterns deemed
                                troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of
                                specific attacks (including those defined by
                                signatures, but also those defined in terms of
                                events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain

                                of failed connection attempts).

                                user space and vice versa.

                                SIPp is a performance testing tool for the SIP protocol.
                                There is a limited support of media plane (RTP).
                                The "PCAP play" feature makes use of libpcap to replay
                                pre-recorded RTP streams towards a destination.
                                RTP streams can be recorded by tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.

                                ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It
                                identifies TCP connections on the chosen network
                                interface and attempts to interpret them as SSLv3/TLS
                                traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
                                decodes the records and displays them in a textual form
                                to stdout. If provided with the appropriate keying
                                material, it will also decrypt the connections and
                                display the application data traffic. It also includes

                                This is a port-knocking server/client.  Port-knocking is a method
                                where a server can sniff one of its interfaces for a special "knock"
                                sequence of port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event
                                bound to that port knock sequence.  These port-hits need not be on
                                open ports, since it uses libpcap to sniff the raw interface
                                traffic.

                                Packet Filter (BPF) expression. The basic model is that you run
                                capstats as a daemon (as root), and it will then take commands from
                                a client. Using a client, you can create new capture sessions,
                                modify them, pull up stats on running sessions, and so on.
