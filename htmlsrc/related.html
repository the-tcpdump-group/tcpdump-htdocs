                                Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction and
                                handling of network packets.  It provides a portable framework for
                                low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.  Libnet
                                features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
                                layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
                                functionality.  Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
                                applications can be whipped up with little effort.

                                TCPslice is a tool for extracting portions of packet
                                trace files generated using tcpdump's <code>-w</code> flag. It
                                can combine multiple trace files, and/or extract
                                portions of one or more traces based on time.
                                TCPslice originally comes from LBL and now is
                                maintained by The Tcpdump Group.

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
                                connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.

                                Zeek detects intrusions by first parsing network

                                and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
                                compare the activity with patterns deemed
                                troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of

                                signatures, but also those defined in terms of

                                of failed connection attempts).

                                CoralReef is a software suite developed by
                                <a class=away href="https://www.caida.org/">CAIDA</a> to analyze data collected
                                by passive Internet traffic monitors.  It provides a programming
                                library libcoral, similar to libpcap with extensions for ATM and
                                other network types, which is available from both C and Perl.  The
                                software presently supports dedicated PC boxes using OC3mon and
                                OC12mon cards that collect traffic data in real time, as well as
                                reading from pcap tracefiles.  Version 3.4 to be released soon
                                supports listening via bpf enabled devices.  CoralReef includes
                                drivers, analysis, web report generation, examples, and capture
                                software.  This package is maintained by CAIDA developers with the
                                support and collaboration of the Internet measurement community.

                                pcapfix is a repair tool for corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It checks

                                are any corrupted bytes. If a header is not present, one is created and
                                added to the beginning of the file. It then tries to find pcap packet
                                headers or packet blocks, and checks and repairs them.

                                sequence of port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event
                                bound to that port knock sequence.  These port-hits need not be on
                                open ports, since it uses libpcap to sniff the raw interface

                                a client. Using a client, you can create new capture sessions,
                                modify them, pull up stats on running sessions, and so on.
