                          reported to The Tcpdump Group via
			  <a href="mailto:security@tcpdump.org">security@tcpdump.org</a>.
                          Please try to keep as close to a responsible disclosure
                          process as is reasonably practicable.  Vulnerabilities
                          that have been deliberately made public by the reporter
                          will <strong>not</strong> be credited.

                          Vulnerabilities will be disclosed to the
                          public at the next release of the software that experiences

                          As a volunteer-run open source software organization, The
                          Tcpdump Group can not promise to release within a set
                          period like 90 days.

                        <p>
                          The Tcpdump Group aims to release at least once a year.
                          This is a best effort commitment.  We will attempt to
                          ship more often but this will depend upon
                          availability of volunteer time and the amount of other
                          work in need of attention.

                        <p>
                          Each release will do its best to credit the
                          reporter with the identifying of the vulnerability.
                          Each confirmed unique issue that applies to a release
                          will be assigned a CVE number at
                          the time of reporting.  You can find a list of the most
                          recently processed CVEs <a href="public-cve-list.txt">here</a>.

                          Bug reports should include a sample <code>.pcap</code> (or
                          <code>.pcapng</code>) file that demonstrates the problem.
                          An effort will be made to keep the sample file
                          confidential until the bug has been fixed. Once
                          fixed, the sample file is expected to be released
                          publicly as part of a test case.
