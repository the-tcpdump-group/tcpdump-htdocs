                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The board ID field indicates which Sniffer device the message is to or
from.  Its value is opaque, with different values for different devices.
</p>
<p>
The length of header field contains the length of the header following
the board ID, in octets, including the header length octet.
</p>
<p>
The length of payload field contains the length of the payload following
the header, in octets.
</p>
<p>
The protocol version field contains the version of this protocol; the
current version is 1.
</p>
<p>
The packet counter field is in little-endian byte order.  In messages
sent from the Sniffer to the host, it contains a count of messages sent
from the Sniffer to the host; in messages sent from the host to the
Sniffer, it contains a count of messages sent from the host to the
Sniffer.  In both cases, the count is modulo 65536.  This can be used to
detect missing packets.
</p>
<p>
The packet type field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00, for a REQ_FOLLOW message sent from the host to the Sniffer to
only send packets recieved from a specific address;</li>
<li>0x01, for an EVENT_FOLLOW message sent from the Sniffer to the host
to indicate that it has entered the FOLLOW state;</li>
<li>0x05, for an EVENT_CONNECT message sent from the Sniffer to the host
to indicate that someone has connected to the unit we are
following;</li>
<li>0x06, for an EVENT_PACKET message sent from the Sniffer to the host,
containing a Bluetooth LE packet captured by the Sniffer;</li>
<li>0x07, for a REQ_SCAN_CONT message sent from the host to the Sniffer,
telling it to scan continuously and hand over the packets ASAP;</li>
<li>0x09, for a EVENT_DISCONNECT message sent from the Sniffer to the
host, telling it that the connected address we were following has
received a disconnect packet;</li>
<li>0x0C, for a SET_TEMPORARY_KEY message, specifying a temporary key to
use on encryption (for OOB and passkey);</li>
<li>0x0D, for a PING_REQ message;</li>
<li>0x0E, for a PING_RESP message;</li>
<li>0x13, for a SWITCH_BAUD_RATE_REQ message;</li>
<li>0x14, for a SWITCH_BAUD_RATE_RESP message;</li>
<li>0x17, for a SET_ADV_CHANNEL_HOP_SEQ message sent from the host to
the Sniffer, telling it which order to cycle through the channels when
following an advertiser;</li>
<li>0xFE, for a GO_IDLE sent from the host to the Sniffer, telling it to
stop sending UART traffic and listen for new commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For an EVENT_PACKET message, the payload has the form:
</p>
<pre>
+---------------------------+
|  Length of payload header |
|          (1 Octet)        |
+---------------------------+
|            Flags          |
|          (1 Octet)        |
+---------------------------+
|           Channel         |
|          (1 Octet)        |
+---------------------------+
|            RSSI           |
|          (1 Octet)        |
+---------------------------+
|        Event counter      |
|          (2 Octets)       |
+---------------------------+
|          Delta time       |
|          (4 Octets)       |
+---------------------------+
|         Bluetooth LE      |
|      Link layer packet    |
.                           .
.                           .
.                           .
</pre>

<p>
The length of payload header field contains the length of the header
preceding the Bluetooth LE packet, including the length of payload
header field.
</p>
<p>
The flags field contains the following flag bits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00000001 - the packet checksum is OK;</li>
<li>0x00000010 - the packet is from the master to the slave;</li>
<li>0x00000100 - the packet is encrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The channel field contains the Bluetooth LE channel index of the channel
being used.
</p>
<p>
The RSSI field contains the absolute value of RSSI of the packet, in
dBm; the actual RSSI is the negative of that value.
</p>
<p>
The event counter field is in little-endian byte order.  For packets
that are part of a connection, it contains the value of a counter of
packets within the connection; there are separate counters for each
direction of the connection.
</p>
<p>
The delta time field is in little-endian byte order.  It contains the
time in microseconds from the end of the previous received packet to the
beginning of this packet.
</p>
<p>
Following the delta time field is a Bluetooth LE link-layer packet.
